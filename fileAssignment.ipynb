    "In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It takes a file path as a parameter and returns a file object that can be used to read, write, or manipulate the contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open() function can be used with different modes to specify the intended operation on the file. Here are the different modes of opening a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "Read mode ('r'): This is the default mode when no mode is specified. It allows you to read the contents of the file. If the file doesn't exist or cannot be opened, a FileNotFoundError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write mode ('w'): This mode is used to write data to a file. If the file exists, its previous contents are truncated (deleted), and a new empty file is created. If the file doesn't exist, a new file is created. If you try to open a file in write mode that you don't have permission to modify, a PermissionError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append mode ('a'): This mode is used to append data to an existing file. If the file exists, the new data is added at the end of the file. If the file doesn't exist, a new file is created. Like write mode, if you don't have permission to modify the file, a PermissionError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary mode ('b'): This mode is used in conjunction with other modes, such as read ('rb') or write ('wb'), to indicate that the file should be treated as a binary file. It is commonly used for reading or writing non-text files like images, audio, video, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text mode ('t'): This mode is used in conjunction with other modes, such as read ('rt') or write ('wt'), to indicate that the file should be treated as a text file. It is the default mode when the 'b' mode is not specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exclusive creation mode ('x'): This mode is used to exclusively create a new file. If the file already exists, a FileExistsError is raised.\n"

    "Question 2\n",
    "The close() function in Python is used to close an opened file. It is important to close a file after you have finished working with it for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource management: When a file is opened, system resources are allocated to it. These resources include memory space, file descriptors, and system buffers. Closing the file releases these resources, ensuring that they can be used for other purposes. Failing to close a file can lead to resource leaks and may cause issues when working with a large number of files or in long-running programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data integrity: Closing a file ensures that all the data you have written to or read from the file is properly flushed and saved. File operations are often buffered, meaning that data is temporarily stored in memory before being written to or read from the file. If you don't close the file, there's a chance that some of the data may not be written or read completely, leading to data corruption or loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent behavior across platforms: Different operating systems handle file operations differently. Some operating systems may impose limitations on the number of files that can be simultaneously opened by a process. By closing the files you no longer need, you avoid reaching these limits and ensure that your program behaves consistently across different platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure proper file handling, it is recommended to follow a common pattern in Python using the with statement. The with statement automatically takes care of closing the file for you once the block of code within it is executed or an exception is raised. Here's an example:\n",
